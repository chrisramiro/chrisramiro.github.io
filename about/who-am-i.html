        The human mind is one of the greatest mysteries humankind has yet to uncover. We are all unique and different in several ways and it absolutely astounds me that my experience of life is so fundamentally difference from any other person. I believe that unlocking the secrets to the human mind has so much potential for humanity -- whether it be technological advancement, treating disease, or increasing human empathy. The things I learn in my classes excite me because it applies to me, as much as it applies to you. It's not just random cell biology, chemicals, or supply &amp; demand, it's something real and palpable, each fact a fact about the human being that is me. </p>
